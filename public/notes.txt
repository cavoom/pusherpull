// APP STUFF
Open with node app.js from Root
Open browser to localhost:3000
indes.html in public has the chart and from
main.js in public handles the event listener and charting

// GENERAL VISUAL STUDIO STUFF
Command T for Terminal
I have added this to Git at cavoom/pusherpull

// DATABASE STUFF
MongoDB mLab Database

pass: $Bigdog54


// THE PROBLEMS
When I go to /routes/poll.js
router.post()
The req.body is null
I can see the points
Just can't get the selection
So do I just need to save at main.js where i do have it?

Temp fix: At poll.js, I auto set the os save value to "Windows" for now
